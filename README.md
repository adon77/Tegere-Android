# TEGERE



## Summary

Tegere integrates directly with [Oxen Service Nodes](https://docs.oxen.io/about-the-oxen-blockchain/oxen-service-nodes), which are a set of distributed, decentralized and Sybil resistant nodes. Service Nodes act as servers which store messages offline, and a set of nodes which allow for onion routing functionality obfuscating users' IP addresses.
